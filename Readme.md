## GAODP Front-End

This code was generated at a Code for Atlanta hack night event.  It pulls together a quick [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples-navbars) navbar and a sample [DataTables](http://datatables.net/examples/data_sources/ajax.html) jQuery plugin solution.

This is simply a start.  More view details and the actual data API can be worked out in the future.  At this point, an API endpoint and format needs to be defined so an AJAX call be set up.
